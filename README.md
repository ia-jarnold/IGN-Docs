# IGN-Docs

## Docker/Gunicorn/Flask/Sphinx Documentation

### Prupose atm is to have a place where when I find intersections between Ignition Versions/Tickets/Subsystems/Loggers I can add them quickly in an organized fashion. If something is documnented already it gets a link in links.rst etc and organized appropriately.

### Good for saving code an scripts quickly and can always be contiusously programmed and templated.

### rst very parsable and readable I believe this supports classic markdown with small extension setting also.

## When I did all the state and fed reproting for cccco each report would have a workflow template generated for each term like our ticket notes in zendesk and I would just keep filling it out and adding depth and evidence until it was basically just the answer after a bit. Not sure how feasable across tickets that is, much larger specs prob need good scenarios that highlight ignition in top down states(traceable).
